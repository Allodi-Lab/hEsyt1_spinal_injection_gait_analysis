# hEsyt1_spinal_injection_gait_analysis

This repository contains the code for the analysis of behavioral data from gait analysis of wt, En1cre, SOD1, and SOD1En1cre mice injected intraspinally with a AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hEsyt1-W3SL virus with the aim of amelorating the motor phenotype observed in the SOD1 mice model of ALS.

The lateral analysis script is used for analyzing angles of foot, ankle, knee and hip for assessing hyperflexion of the limbs.
The ventral analysis script is used for analyzing changes in the gait parameters of average speed, peak acceleration, step frequency (cadence) and stride length.

Data will be uploaded when the paper has been published.
